# Custom Data Structures C++

Making custom data structures in C++ to better understand memory management, pointers, and templates. I plan to create these data structures as practice.
 - ArrayList
 - LinkedList
 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Set
 - Map

 ## To Run

Run these commands from the root of the project folder

```bash
 cmake -S . -B build
 cmake --build build    
 ./build/DataStructures
 ```
